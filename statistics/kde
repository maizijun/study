## this is for the kernal density estimation

given a set of points, we want to build a model so that when a new point comes, we can do the prediction, kde is the nonparametric method.
We draw a scatter plot of (x,y) and make several bins, each new point estimation is the y in which the bin x is in.

But it has one main problem: how to set the appropriate bin width. When the width is to much, the estimate is too roughï¼Œotherwise, the curve 
maybe not be enouch smooth. we want to find the appropriate bin width
