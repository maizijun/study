## this file is for gaussian process

given sets (xi,yi), we do the prediction yi+1 when xi+1 comes. we need to estimate p(yi+1|xi+1)

p(y|x) = N(0,cov + a * I), cov is the covariance matrix and a is for random turbulance

we will estimate the i+1 * i+1 covariance matrix like the form(Cn,k
                                                               k.t(), c)
                                                               
cn is the covariance funcation and k is the kernal function xi+1 between xk for k in 1 to i

so p(yI+1|X,Y) will follow a gaussian distribution with mean xxx and variance xxxxx
